# in CI; see the "Brand-isolation guard" step in .github/workflows/validate.yml)
# rather than hardcoded here, so the public source never enumerates the protected
# terms. To run locally, export BRAND_BLOCKLIST first.

#   - exact path: matches only the named file (e.g. "NOTICE")
#   - path ending in /: matches any file under that directory
#
# See CONTRIBUTING.md "Brand isolation" for the rule and rationale.
